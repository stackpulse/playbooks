This playbook extracts logs from a failed Kubernetes job and optionally allows to delete it.

## Your benefits

- Get the current logs of a container, which can easily point directly to the root cause
- Provide information from production Kubernetes clusters without having to provide multiple people direct access to production
- Assist engineers to handle production issues by getting a wider context regardless of their Kubernetes expertise level
